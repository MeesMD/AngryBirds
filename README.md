# AngryBirds
This project is a recreation of the popular Angry Birds game. I did this project purely because I was interessted in making a mobile game and forces in Unity.
You can shoot a bird by pulling him back on the catapult if you pull the bird further back it will be lauched harder. You can destroy pigs or objects if you hit them  with a force that you can set.

## Engine
Unity.

## Language
C#.
